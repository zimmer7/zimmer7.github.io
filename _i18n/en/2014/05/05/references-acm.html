<p><a href="http://acmedien.de" title="ACM Unternehmensgruppe GmbH">ACM</a> approached us with quite a nice challenge: To ease the growth of the groups individual objects, they needed a
framework that allows all websites to share a common grid, common base code and one central place to write content for them.
But of course, all editors should be restricted to their individual objectâ€™s website.</p>

<p>What made it way easier was, that they already evaluated different CMS and decided that <a href="/stack/#typo3">TYPO3</a> would be a solution
for them.</p>

<p>Several month into the project, six objects have been relaunched with the new framework. The pages are served to roughly
22.000 Users per month, generating approxmately 70.000 hits. 40 Editors are working with their 25.000 news articles. And
there are more objects to come.</p>
