<p><a href="http://www.leitmotiv-bikes.de/" title="DT Leitmotiv GmbH">Leitmotiv</a> had the vision to launch a small website with a shop that allows the interested biker
to configure their individual high-end bike. Of course, while you configure the bike, both price and weight are
updated live, so you always know how much you have to carry both uphill and to the shop.</p>

<p>As they specialize in high-end bikes, they left the decision of server, architecture and framework completely to
us. The result is a server managed by <a href="/stack/#chef">Chef</a>, running a lightweight page via <a href="/stack/#nodejs">node.js</a>,
using data and images from <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org" title="Apache CouchDB">Apache CouchDB</a>.</p>
