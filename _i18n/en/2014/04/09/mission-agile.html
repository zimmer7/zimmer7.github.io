<p>While “agile” is definitely one of the most thrown around buzzwords in the last few years, the except from the <a href="http://agilemanifesto.org" title="Agile Manifesto">Agile Manifesto</a> sums up our philosophy pretty nicely:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Responding to change over following a plan

<p>When developing a project for you, we want to understand your problem and then iterate on that together with you, to ensure the result is both what you expected and actually solving your problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Computers are good at following instructions, but not at reading your mind.
