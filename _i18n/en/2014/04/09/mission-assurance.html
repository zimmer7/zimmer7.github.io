<p>High quality is worth nothing if it degrades over time.</p>

<p>To fight that, we employ well known best practices in continous integration and code metrics to ensure and visualize our quality level stays the same or gets better with every commit we make.</p>

<p>Training new coders to our code is easy, because e.g. differences in style, unused methods and variables are pointed out to them and therefore easily fixed.</p>
