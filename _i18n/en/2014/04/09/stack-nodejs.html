<p><a href="http://nodejs.org" title="node.js">node.js</a>, being one of the most rapidly growing server side technologies, caught our eye quite early on.</p>

<p>Since then we have built smaller sites and webservices with it and we like it a lot. It enables a test-driven workflow with a fast pace to get a project up and running quickly, while scaling great.</p>

<p>And because node.js is just JavaScript, you can share code between the backend and the frontend, reducing the time needed for completion.</p>

<p>In 2012 we started the <a href="http://node.js-mannheim.de/">node.js MeetUp Mannheim</a>, meeting every month to share knowledge, ideas and insights.</p>
