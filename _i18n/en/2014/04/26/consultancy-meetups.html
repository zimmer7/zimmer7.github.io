<p>While we can certainly be booked to teach your team a certain technology, we believe,
that sharing knowledge freely is one of the fundamental principles that drives the world.
Heck, it is even the very reason the internet was built for.</p>

<p>So we regularily attend UserGroups, MeetUps and conferences to both share and receive knowledge about
the technologies we use and enjoy.</p>

<p>See our <a href="/contact/#in-person">in-person</a> page on where and when to find us.</p>
