<p>On projects above a certain size, planning the fundament is crucial to ensure a smooth
project path over time and enable the system to scale, grow and still be maintainable.</p>

<p>So does code! But in web-development, there are several technologies to decouple certain subsystems
and therefore allow them to grow and change indedepently of oneanother. Instead of building monolithic
monsters, one should opt for simple systems specialized in certain tasks:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Write programs that do one thing and do it well.
Write programs to work together.
Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.

<p>Simple text streams can be replaced e.g. by message-queues where need be, but the underlaying principle
is as true nowadays as it has been in the 70s during the early phases of UNIX.</p>
